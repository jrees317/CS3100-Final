Final
Requirements

The nutrition director, along with the school principal, wants a more efficient cafeteria processing system that will keep track of studentsâ€™ meals and balances. 
Each student has a unique six-digit ID number. Students must be linked to at least one parent/guardian (for payment purposes). The parent contact will have a unique six-digit ID number along with name, address, phone number, and email recorded. The unique identifier for meals will be a five-digit ID number and a description of the meal will also be included.
A student may purchase several meals but each transaction is associated with only one student. A transaction is made for only one meal. Transactions have a unique seven-digit number as an identifier and date, time, and transaction amounts are recorded as well. 
A regular paying student price is $3.00 for a lunch meal, and reduced paying student price is $0.40.
A payment can be made by the student through cash, check or credit card (unless it is free then, there is no payment). An instance of payment is associated with only one customer. Payment will be uniquely identified by a six-digit number, and amount, date, payment method, processor, and notes will be recorded. 
Parent/guardian are associated with students for the sole purpose of receiving monthly meal statements.
